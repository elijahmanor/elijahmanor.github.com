title: From Ghost to Jekyll

So, I was using the Node.js [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging engine for over a year and it was going pretty well. However, the biggest frustration for me was updating to the latest version of the engine on my host server. I ended up upgraded several times and each time ended up being much more work than I had intended.

The last time I had a scare moment where I almost lost years of blog posts. Thankfully I had several recent back-ups and was able to recover the content, but I had to do quite a bit of work to get it usable again.

Anyway, I figured it was time to switch to a statically generated blog engine, which is where Jekyll comes into the story. I have several friends ([damon_bauer][] [jmmcduffie][] [buddylreno][]) who use Jekyll for their blogs and they enjoy it. I'm not a Ruby developer, but you don't really have to be to use Jekyll.

I've found that the documentation is pretty good and my favorite part is that GitHub Pages knows about Jekyll! I can push to GitHub the raw Jekyll files and it will automatically generate the static blog for me!
