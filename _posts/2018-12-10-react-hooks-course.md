<img src="../assets/images/2018/Dec/EGH_ReactHooks.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; padding: 0;" /> This week my latest [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) course was launched
entitled, [Reusable State and Effects with React Hooks](https://egghead.io/courses/reusable-state-and-effects-with-react-hooks).

Previously, in order to add state or side-effects in React you had to create a Class Component. However, with the introduction of the Hooks proposal (currently pre-released), you can now add state and effects to a Function Component. In addition, you can extract your hook logic and create a custom hook that can be shared across your app.
