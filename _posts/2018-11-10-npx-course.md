<img src="../assets/images/2018/Nov/EGH_NPM-NPX.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; padding: 0;" /> Last week my latest [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io) course was launched, [Execute npm Package Binaries with the npx Package Runner](https://egghead.io/courses/execute-npm-package-binaries-with-the-npx-package-runner).

[`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is a tool that comes baked in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (if you have version 5.2 or above), that you may or may not know about. Itâ€™s a handy little utility that enables you to play around with node packages in a way that wasnâ€™t really easy before.

> ðŸ†“ The course is currently free to watch until Thursday November 15th. So, watch today!

## Lessons

The following lessons are included in the `npx` course. For those that regularly use `npm` and `npm scripts`, lessons 1 and 2 are big improvements to your command-line workflow. Lessons 3 through 7 focus on uncovering some lesser known features of `npx` that I find are useful.

1. [Use npx to run locally installed node modules](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-run-locally-installed-node-modules)
2. [Use npx to Temporarily Install and Invoke a Package from npm](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-temporarily-install-and-invoke-a-package-from-npm)
3. [Test Different Node Module Versions with npx](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-test-different-node-module-versions-with-npx)
4. [Use npx to run commands with different Node.js versions](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-run-commands-with-different-node-js-versions)
5. [Execute npx commands with $npm_ Environment Variables](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-execute-npx-commands-with-npm_-environment-variables)
6. [Execute Code from a Remote GitHub Branch with npx](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-execute-code-from-a-remote-github-branch-with-npx)
7. [Use npx to execute code from a GitHub gist](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-execute-code-from-a-github-gist)

## Course Reviews

Some reviews have already started coming in for this course. The following is a taste of what some are saying thus far. 

> "So many great little tips! lolcatjs, the bash brace expansion, the resume/CLI idea. Plus it was short and easily-digestible. Lots of this is immediately-applicable to our team, and lots of it is fun to know."

> "I seriously had no idea `npx` was capable of so much. Nicely done!"

> "Elijah's instructions are clear, sufficiently detailed and unambigous. I can't wait to put my learning to good use. Thanks a lot for this wonderful course."

> "The course contains a lot of useful information and the presentation of the instructor is engaging. Thank you!"

> "I did not suspect npx could be so helpful. After this training, I will keep it in my toolbox for sure. Thanks for this clear and straight to the point course."

> "Highly recommend for all Frontend devs. You'll learn a couple of tips and tricks about npx. Thank you Elijah!"

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy the course and find something useful that you can start using in your projects.
