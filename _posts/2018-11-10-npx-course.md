<img src="../assets/images/2018/Nov/EGH_NPM-NPX.png" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; padding: 0;" /> Last week my latest [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) course was launched
entitled, [Execute npm Package Binaries with the npx Package
Runner](https://egghead.io/courses/execute-npm-package-binaries-with-the-npx-package-runner).

`npx` is a tool that comes baked in `npm` (if you have version 5.2 or above), that you may or may not know about. It’s a handy little utility that enables you to play around with node packages in a way that wasn’t really easy before.

I find myself using `npx` all the time. It’s a tool I use most days.

> *🆓 The course is currently free to watch until Thursday November 15th. So, watch today!*

### Lessons

The following lessons are included in the `npx`
[course](https://egghead.io/courses/execute-npm-package-binaries-with-the-npx-package-runner).
For those that regularly use `npm` and `npm scripts`, lessons 1 and 2 are big
improvements to your command-line workflow. Lessons 3 through 7 focus on
uncovering some lesser known features of `npx` that I find are useful.

1.  [Use npx to run locally installed node
modules](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-run-locally-installed-node-modules)
1.  [Use npx to Temporarily Install and Invoke a Package from
npm](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-temporarily-install-and-invoke-a-package-from-npm)
1.  [Test Different Node Module Versions with
npx](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-test-different-node-module-versions-with-npx)
1.  [Use npx to run commands with different Node.js
versions](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-run-commands-with-different-node-js-versions)
1.  [Execute npx commands with $npm_ Environment
Variables](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-execute-npx-commands-with-npm_-environment-variables)
1.  [Execute Code from a Remote GitHub Branch with
npx](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-execute-code-from-a-remote-github-branch-with-npx)
1.  [Use npx to execute code from a GitHub
gist](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-execute-code-from-a-github-gist)

### Having Fun with `npx`

As I teach `npx` I also try to keep things fun and faced paced. The following GIF shows a small clip from the 2nd lesson, [Use npx to Temporarily Install and Invoke a Package from
npm](https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-use-npx-to-temporarily-install-and-invoke-a-package-from-npm), where I experiment with various packages without installing them globally.

Who knew [`devpun`](https://npm.im/devpun), [`cowsay`](https://npm.im/cowsay), and [`lolcatjs`](https://npm.im/lolcatjs) could be so fun!?!
