You may have noticed recently that I've tweeted some Front-End Web Developer jokes here and there. The feedback I've received has ranged from "Ha ha" to "Groan" to "Unfollow". I think most of those responses are out of fun, but who knows :) Others have encouraged me to continue making more jokes and have wondered where they can see a list of all the puns.

So, without further ado here are the jokes I've authored thus far. Please, don't groan all at once...

> NOTE: I've created several new puns since this post. I'll list them at the bottom in a new section. I've also created a JavaScript library and CLI program called [devpun](https://npm.im/devpun) that includes all of these puns.

* q. How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? a. You console it

* When a JavaScript date has gone bad, "Don't call me, I'll callback you. I promise!"

* q. Why was the JavaScript developer sad? a. Because he didn't Node how to Express himself

* q. Why do C# and Java developers keep breaking their keyboards a. Because they use a strongly typed language

* q. Why did the developer go broke? a. Because he used up all his cache

* Dev1 saw a strange JavaScript function & asked, "What is this?". Dev2 responded, "I don't know. I would've called you, but I was in a bind"

* Two JavaScript developers walked into the variable bar. Ouch!

* q. Why did Jason cover himself with bubble wrap? a. Because he wanted to make a cross-domain JSONP request

* q. Why did the software company hire drama majors from Starbucks? a. Because they needed JavaScript experts!

* q. Why did the CoffeeScript developer keep getting lost? a. Because he couldn't find his source without a map

* q. What do you call `__proto__`? a. Dunder proto q. Michael Scott was the regional manager where? a. `__mifflin__`

* q. How did the doctor revive the developer? a. The dev wasn't responsive so the doc picked him up by his bootstraps

* q. Why did the C# developer fall asleep? a. Because he didn't like Java.

* q. Why did the JavaScript boxer goto the chiropractor? a. Because his backbone was angular from a knockout and required attention

* q. How did the web developer hurt Comic Sans feelings? a. Once he saw the font he quickly changed it to Open Sans and exclaimed "In your @font-face!"

* q. Why was Ember.js turning red? a. Because it was EMBERrassed for not remEMBERing its route home

* q. Why did the jQuery developer never have financial problems? a. Because he was in $.noConflict() mode

Yeah, I know those were very cheesy pun-like jokes, but that is how I roll ;) I hope you somewhat enjoyed the jokes... if not, that's no problem too. I hope you have a great week and enjoy yourself today.
